Team 15, otherwise known as Oompa Loompas, worked hard at the problem statement given to us by our NGO, JAHK. We developed a full-stack web application, targeting to alleviate the current pain points faced. Here is the front-end repository, and the live prototype used for demonstration is hosted at [https://cfg-2020-team15-fe.vercel.app/](https://cfg-2020-team15-fe.vercel.app/)

Should you be interested to run the development server, execute the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jerrenss/CFG2020-Team15-FE.git

yarn

yarn dev
```
